## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/SmrutiRekhaRana/Loan-Portfolio-Monitoring-Dashboard/blob/main/Bank_Loans_Dataset.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total outstanding amount and the number of loans by month?
- How has the loan portfolio performed on a quarterly basis?
- How is the outstanding loan amount distributed across different loan classifications?
- What is the total outstanding amount by previous loan classifications?
- What is the level of risk in the current loan portfolio?
- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/SmrutiRekhaRana/Loan-Portfolio-Monitoring-Dashboard/blob/main/Loan_Portfolio_Monitor.png">View Dashboard</a>

## Process
- Import and prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values and transforming necessary fields.
- Build visualizations like line charts, bar graphs, and matrix tables to display KPIs (e.g., Amount Outstanding by Month, Classification Shifts).
- Identify trends, risks, and performance shifts (e.g., loan migration between classifications, delinquency rates).
- Enhance interactivity with slicers and filters, and improve dashboard usability based on requirment.
