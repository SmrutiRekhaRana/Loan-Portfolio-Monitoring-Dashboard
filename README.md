## Questions (KPIs)

## Process
- Import and prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values and transforming necessary fields.
- Build visualizations like line charts, bar graphs, and matrix tables to display KPIs (e.g., Amount Outstanding by Month, Classification Shifts).
- Identify trends, risks, and performance shifts (e.g., loan migration between classifications, delinquency rates).
- Enhance interactivity with slicers and filters, and improve dashboard usability based on requirment.
